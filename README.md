# FetchRewardsCodingAssignment
 
 This Android application uses MVVM architecture to fetch service from the network and populates the UI. I have used 25 as the minimum API version and the        target version is 30. So it runs on most of the modern devices.

 a screen shows the item id and item name corresponding to the list id.
 
 Here is a sample flow.
