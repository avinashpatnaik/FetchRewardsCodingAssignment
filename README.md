# FetchRewardsCodingAssignment
 
 This Android application uses MVVM architecture to fetch service from the network and populates the UI. I have used 25 as the minimum API version and the        target version is 30. So it runs on most of the modern devices.
 
 I have used a basic UI shown below which has a splashscreen, a grid screen that groups the items based on list id. Upon clicking on one of the grid items,
 a screen shows the item id and item name corresponding to the list id.
 
 Here is a sample flow.
